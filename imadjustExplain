For input image, say f, of class uint8:
Function IMADJUST does the folllowing things
1.Normalizaion: im2double(f), that is , dividing all the entries in f by 255.
2.Gamma Correction is done before linear mapping
   For example:
   (f,[0 1], [0 0.5], 2) will raise all the entries to the power 2 and then
   dividing all the entries by 2 (half).
3.Convert back to the original image class
   im2uint8()
uint8 [-->double [0 1]-->gamma correction-->linear mapping-->uint8]
where the things done by IMADJUST is expressed in [].

For class double, the input image values must be in [0 1],
otherwise, the values less than 0 map to 0 and the values higher than 1 map to 1
then do gamma correction and linear mapping.
